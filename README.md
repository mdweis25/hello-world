# hello-world
My First GitHub Repository<br>
I am an aspiring, self-taught developer, named Michael Weis. I'm looking to start some projects with the goal of providing for myself and my family. A few of the languages I have been learning include: HTML, CSS, PHP, Python, JavaScript, and C#. Recently, I purchased a system that I would like to use as server. Right now I'm learning about PHP formdata. I would love to find someone to collaborate with and would not mind if you leave a file right on this branch so we could dm :D
